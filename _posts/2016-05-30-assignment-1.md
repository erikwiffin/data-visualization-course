After looking through the codebook for the GapMinder data, I have decided that I am particularly interested in GDP per capita and how it corelates with different types of consumption. The codebook is pretty short, so I can include the entire thing in my personal codebook.

I watched the very interesting video [Don&rsquo;t Panic](http://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/) on the GapMinder website, and it got me interested in how GDP per capita correlates to different variables. In particular, at about 46:30, they show a few examples of infant mortality rate being a leading indicator for a take-off in GDP per capita growth. I&rsquo;d like to investigate that further, but lacking historical data for now, I will have to make do with
point-in-time associations.

I will focus on the association between GDP and different types of consumption (alcohol consumption per adult, CO2 emissions, Internet users, and oil consumption per capita).

## Existing literature

This is a fairly well covered field of research. I searched for [correlation between gdp per capita and consumption](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=correlation+between+gdp+per+capita+and+consumption) and found several articles on the subject.

In [Causality relationship between electricity consumption and GDP in Bangladesh](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421505003320)[1] they found that there was a causal relationship from per capita GDP to per capita energy consumption.

However, [Energy consumption and GDP: causality relationship in G-7 countries and emerging markets](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988302000099)[2] found causality running in the opposite direction.

[Manufacturing Epidemics: The Role of Global Producers in Increased Consumption of Unhealthy Commodities Including Processed Foods, Alcohol, and Tobacco](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001235)[3] seems to indicate that increased GDP is correlated with increased consumption of "unhealthy commodities", but only up to a point, where it becomes a weaker correlation.

## Hypothesis

My hypothesis is that there is a correlation between GDP and consumption of alcohol, co2, internet, and oil, but that that correlation becomes weaker as GDP rises.
