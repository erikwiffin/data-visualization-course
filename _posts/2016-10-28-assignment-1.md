# Sample

The sample is from the GapMinder World dataset. It contains one year of data across 15 measures, including GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth and estimated HIV Prevalence for 215 areas (countries, geographical entities, semiautonomous territories and disputed territories). The GapMinder World dataset collects data from several sources, including the Institute for	Health Metrics and Evaluation, US Census Bureauâ€™s International Database, United Nations Statistics Division, and the World Bank.

# Procedure

For GDP per capita, the dataset is based on GDP per capita, in fixed 2005 prices, and is adjusted for Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs), as calculated in the 2005 round of the International Comparison Program (ICP).

For life expectancy at birth, there were two main sources: a) Human Mortality Database and b) UN Population divisions World Population Prospects. As a first priority, data from Human Mortality Database (HMD) was used where available. For countries and/or time periods where the HMD did not have data, World Population Prospect was used, if available.

For estimated HIV Prevalence, data was gathered from a 2008 report from UNAIDS/WHO estimations on the current and previous state of the epidemic for most low and middle income countries.

# Measures

2010 Gross Domestic Product per capita in constant 2000 US$. The
inflation but not the differences in the cost of living between countries has been taken into account.

2011 life expectancy at birth (years). The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.

2009 estimated HIV Prevalence % - (Ages 15-49). Estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.
