After looking through the codebook for the GapMinder data, I have decided that I am particularly interested in GDP per capita and how it corelates with different types of consumption. The codebook is pretty short, so I can include the entire thing in my personal codebook.

I watched the very interesting video [Don&rsquo;t Panic](http://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/) on the GapMinder website, and it got me interested in how GDP per capita correlates to different variables. In particular, at about 46:30, they show a few examples of infant mortality rate being a leading indicator for a take-off in GDP per capita growth. I&rsquo;d like to investigate that further, but lacking historical data for now, I will have to make do with
point-in-time associations.

I will focus on the association between GDP and different types of consumption (alcohol consumption per adult, CO2 emissions, Internet users, and oil consumption per capita).
